# DisWho

Simple API to get informations about a user or an invite on Discord.

### âš  Do not use this API in production

This API is used by some of my projects. It is public (https://diswho.androz2091.fr) but I don't guarantee its availability, and it could become offline overnight if I don't need it for my projects. So host it yourself if you need it.
